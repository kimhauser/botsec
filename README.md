# botsec - Deny unwanted search-bots
 A PHP script for denying and redirecting unwanted search bots which may be causing a huge traffic on your website. You may use, copy, amend and redistribute this PHP script in all your projects whether it's personal or commercial. The script is licensed under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and freely available for everyone.

This is an example usage of the "botsec.php" script. It'll redirect you to https://google.com if the user-agent of the request is in the array to check.

## Implementation of the script
* Open the file **botsec.php** and amend the array **$agentsToDeny** in the script with your own search-bots you want to deny
* Also change the **$redirectLocation** variable to a location you want the bots to be redirected to if needed
* Upload or place the script to your webserver where your root or main index.php file (or any other script you want the function to apply) is. 
* Inlcude the botsec.php file like so:

```php
<?php
	require("botsec.php");
?>
```
* That's it. Every request to the website including the **botsec.php** script from a user-agent which is in the **$agentsToDeny** array is now beeing redirected to the URL stated in the **$redirectLocation** variable
